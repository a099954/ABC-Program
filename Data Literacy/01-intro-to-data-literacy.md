# Lesson: Introduction to Data Literacy

## Introduction

The world runs on data. Companies are making decisions every day using data. The journey from data to information to interpretation to a decision is a long, bumpy road. 

This lesson explains data literacy and why it is essential. It also provides characteristics and examples of a data-driven workplace. The difference between Big Data and data is delineated to ensure clarity and appropriate term use.  

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. Explain the concept of data literacy.
2. Identify the importance of data literacy.
3. Describe the characteristics of a data-driven workplace.
4. Differentiate Big Data from data.
5. Define cognitive and statistical bias.

## What is Data Literacy?

What is **data literacy**?  If you think about literacy from a non-data perspective, according to [the Cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/literacy), it is "the ability to read and write."  When it comes to data literacy, it is the ability to read data and make informed decisions based on that data.

[Forbes describes data literacy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/06/05/why-data-management-and-data-literacy-need-to-go-together/#7e7708337021) as "using data effectively for business actions and outcomes."

[Gartner explains data literacy](https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/data-literacy) as "having the ability to read, write and communicate data in context, including an understanding of data sources and constructs, analytical methods and techniques applied, and the ability to describe the use case, application and resulting value."

Gartner's explanation goes into more detail rather than simply leaving it as reading and writing.  It includes the importance of being able to communicate that data in context.

When it comes to data literacy, we don't just focus on reading the data. We evaluate the entire lifecycle from raw data to information. Our goal is how to be data literate citizens throughout the whole process.  

We will explain techniques for reading the data, and we will teach you to question that data.  We will show you the biases the data may include and how to be aware of those.  

We will teach you the terminology of data when it comes to tables. We will show you other visualizations and when to use them effectively.  We will talk about data models, attributes, and relationships.  We will also include things to notice about the world of Big Data.  

Why do we take our data literacy journey through the whole process?  It is important to realize that it isn't merely gathering data and changing it into information to make decisions.  

> When you gain insight into the whole process, you are better armed with an understanding of what it takes to go from raw data to information.  When you know the data's steps, you can question and gain more confidence in challenging the data presented to you.

So for us, data literacy involves reading, questioning, seeking understanding, communicating what is being presented, and using the data to inform decisions.

## The Importance of Data Literacy

Why is it important to have a data-literate workplace?  Well, take this scenario into account: What if you didn't know how to read visualizations? You may inadvertently be making decisions with incomplete or inaccurate information.  Inventory might look like it is out of stock based on a graph, but when presented in context, that was last week's inventory levels before the latest arrivals were counted.  Shipping routes may be overloaded because someone didn't see the data for a truck's route, and other shipments were scheduled simultaneously.  What looks like it is smooth sailing may very well be a dumpster fire in disguise.

### Being Data Literate Empowers You

* When you are data literate, you can identify the **source of truth** - where the data originated and lives.  
* You can question the context of the data - When was it gathered? How was it gathered? Who did the gathering?
* You can ask about biases and why an outcome looks skewed.  
* You can ask about data that appears missing and how that impacts the visualizations.  

In an environment where data literacy is encouraged, you will see a more solid understanding of data, its context, and better-informed decisions being made.  A data-literate organization has multiple eyes on the data, numerous perspectives questioning the data, and more ways to possibly catch misinformation before it gets out publicly and spreads like wildfire, as it does in the social media world.

## Characteristics of a Data-Driven Workplace

What are the characteristics of a data-driven workplace?  A lot of reports and dashboards!  When a company is data-driven, the **data culture** is evident from the top-level executives to the management to regular workers.  Reports and **dashboards** provide a high-level overview with many visualizations, similar to a dashboard view in a vehicle. This overview allows someone to see their team's efficiency, where specific cost centers may be slower, and low inventory supply.  

* Logistics folks are looking at reports to ensure truck routes aren't getting overloaded and that shipping and deliveries are running on time.
* The sales team is looking to see if there are different times of the year when sales are up or when sales are down, understanding the seasonality of their products and services.
* The business is looking at the supply and demand and making sure they can keep up with the demand.  
* Accounting folks are looking at reports to see how much money is due via accounts receivable versus how much money is due out via accounts payable and payroll.
* Marketing is looking at analytics to see how their marketing campaigns are faring. They are looking at website traffic, eCommerce promotions, and other engagement statistics to see how their marketing efforts perform.
* IT is looking at the web traffic and server logs, ensuring everything is working correctly and can handle the traffic.  

Data is everywhere. In a data-driven workplace, everyone uses data in their day-to-day responsibilities.

In a data-driven workplace, data is accessible and shared. There are no data silos. Some groups may take ownership of the data. However, there is still data sharing and knowledge sharing, instead of hoarding the knowledge and only making it available to select groups of people - such as executives - at select times - such as board meetings and the annual company meeting.

Data-driven workplaces may have the role of the Chief Data Officer (CDO).  The CDO is responsible for managing a data literate workforce.  They organize training so that the data is better managed and easier to analyze.  They work with a team to ensure their data is stored so that it can be retrieved by those who need it and remain secure and inaccessible to those who shouldn't access it.  The Chief Data Officer leads the way on digital transformations within a company.

### Data Availability

There is a rise in data availability within data-driven workplaces, and data is exposed in ways that make it consumable. Programmers create application programming interfaces (APIs) to expose data. Some vendors provide tools vendors that make it easier to export their data.

From enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to customer relationship management (CRM) systems to product information management (PIM) systems, many tools used in businesses support exporting or extracting their data for further reporting.  

In addition to the tools making it easier to access data, companies and governments release their data via the open data movement. This movement calls for more data releases to the public and grants more transparency to processes.

Big Data is yet another way that data is becoming available.  With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and machines on networks and reporting telemetry and analytics, data is coming in more frequently and in larger batches than it did 20 years ago.  With the generation of so much data, there is a demand for live results and live streaming data.  Big Data processing and leveraging the cloud's power and scalability help make more data more available.

### Gathering Data

When it comes to gathering data, the data-driven workplace looks at what data is being gathered.  It looks for data that is relevant, timely, accurate, clean, unbiased, and trustworthy.  

Data is organized in a queryable way - both by programming languages and by human terms.  Humans can look at the data, ask about its context, question any intentions going into the data gathering and understand the entire data process.  Data is cleaned and shaped to alert people when a specific metric or threshold has been met and for reporting.

Collaboration across business units, knowledge sharing, curiosity about data, all of these things are important in a data-driven workplace.  There is an open-mindedness as well as a willingness to learn.  The data-driven workplace is continually experimenting and improving, and adjusting based on the experiment's outcomes. Data is commonly seen in decision-making and business strategy.  

There is always room to grow, improve, and evolve in a data-driven business, and change is welcomed.

### Bias in Data

Finding and gathering available data is just the start. How that data is initially collected, reported, and how you interpret it is another story that is further complicated by the presence of **cognitive** and **statistical** bias. 

Cognitive bias deals with subjective reality and is rooted in thinking. Cognitive bias involves your conscience and is influenced by your surroundings and upbringing. Your memories and motivation can also come into play with cognitive biases. While many people may associate cognitive bias with action, it can also be seen as inaction. Common cognitive biases include confirmation bias, hindsight bias, anchoring, and omission bias.

Statistical bias occurs when the observed quantitative values do not align with the expected values, and the quantitative values do not represent the entire group. Often this happens when the sample or the surveyed audience does not necessarily represent the population - the whole group of people being represented. This can also involve bias in machine learning algorithms and mathematical equations due to other people's cognitive biases. Common statistical biases include survivorship, sampling, observer, and seasonal biases.

Being aware of bias is the first step in understanding the data before you. It's also important to understand whether your decision may be impacted by others' or even your own biases.


## How does Big Data differ from data?

With the rise of data availability, **Big Data** - data at a massive scale - is a term that comes up often.  Big Data is a subset of data focused on scaling and streaming.  Live datastreams, getting updated right now, with data on demand - this is the world of Big Data.  With significant amounts of data, there tends to be a need for more performance and scalability, which comes from the cloud - servers on the Internet built specifically for processing data and growing and scaling as needed.

How big are we talking?  Our desktop processing tends to cap out around gigabytes. The cloud can process terabytes, petabytes, and even exabytes of data. We are talking about large amounts of data.  

<a href="https://events.static.linuxfound.org/sites/events/files/slides/Netflix Integrating Spark at Petabyte Scale.pdf">Netflix</a> deals with 500 billion events/day, transmitted in 15-minute increments.  It is working on a petabyte-scale.  Even bigger than Netflix, <a href="https://decrypt.co/48938/bigger-than-netflix-filecoin-hits-1-exabyte-storage">Filecoin</a> is dealing with an **exabyte** of storage.  An exabyte is 1 thousand petabytes, 1 million terabytes, 1 billion gigabytes, or 1 trillion megabytes.

## The 3 V's of Big Data

There are several factors that make Big Data stand out. The three most obvious are:

1. Volume - how much data is there?
2. Velocity - how fast is the data coming in?
3. Variety - how structured is the data?

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we gave an overview of the many factors that we consider in data literacy.  Throughout this module, we will explore the various pieces that make up data literacy and work towards feeling more confident in our data understanding.
