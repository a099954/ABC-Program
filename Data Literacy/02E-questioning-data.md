# Exercise: Questioning Data

## Introduction

When presented data or visualizations, you should have the instinct to question the data. In this exercise, we will view sample data and formulate questions to help us better understand the data being presented.

## Goals

- Question unlabeled presentations.
- Check relevant data.

## Sample Data 1

![Rating vs Percent, No Labels](assets/images/questionable-scatterplot.png)

### Prompts

- What does this scatterplot represent? 
- The axes don't start at 0, 0. With the x-axis labels starting at 40 and the y-axis labels starting at 1.0 - rather than starting at 0,0 - what insights can you gather from the axes' starting points?

- What questions do you have?


## Sample Data 1 with Labeled Axes

![Rating vs Percent, Labels No Context](assets/images/slightly-less-obscure-scatterplot.png)

### Prompts

- The axes are labeled, but there still is not enough context here. What exactly does this represent?
- Is this number of ratings of a test versus the percent scores on a test?
- What questions do you have?

## Sample Data 1 with Labels and Title

![Cocoa Percent vs Rating](assets/images/full-scatterplot-with-labels.png)

### Prompts

- This is the relationship of cocoa percent vs. the rating. This is from [the Chocolate Bar Ratings dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings) on Kaggle.
- What do you notice about this data and the relationship between cocoa percent and rating?

## Sample Data 2

A line graph can be used to show how things trend over time. The following line graph shows the Olympic medals for Australia over the years.

### Prompt

- What questions do you have when presented with this data?
