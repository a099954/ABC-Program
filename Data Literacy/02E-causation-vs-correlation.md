# Exercise: Correlation Does Not Equal Causation

## Introduction

By now, we all know that correlation does not always equal causation, but how often does this fallacy show up in real life? As it turns out, a lot. In this exercise, you will work in groups of two or three to research a well-known causation fallacy and report it back to the class. 

## Research

The instructor will assign your group one of the following causation fallacies:

- Hawthorn Effect
- Monte Carlo Fallacy (gambler's fallacy)
- John Henry Effect
- Sport's Fan (and Player) Superstitions
- Super Bowl Wins Impacting the Stock Market
- Eating Breakfast Reduces Obesity

Your group will research your fallacy and answer the following questions:

1. What action supposedly causes another? 
1. How did your topic get its name? (if applicable)
1. Why is this not an example of causation? 
1. Is there data that could be used to prove causation?
1. What are your sources?
1. Are the sources you found reliable?

## Presentation

After 30 minutes of research, come back to the main classroom and share your findings with the class. Share your sources in the class chat.
