# Exercise: The Data Game

## Introduction

If you've never seen one of the many recreations of "The Dating Game," now is your chance to get in on the excitement that comes from gathering data - not about three potential suitors - but online data sets! By the end of the game, you'll pick the data that's right for you!

## The Process

1. Your instructor will represent data sets One, Two, and Three. <!-- to be added to instructor guide: suggested Best data set answer based on: https://www.data.gov/; Bias data set answer based on https://naturallivingfamily.com/best-essential-oils/; and untidy data https://gist.github.com/Kimmirikwa/b69d0ea134820ea52f8481991ffae93e#file-student_results-csv -->
1. Everyone in class will take turns asking questions to help you determine if the data set you're gathering is biased, has missing data, or if it is untidy.
1. After each learner asks two questions, you'll work as a team to pick the dataset that's right for you (the one you think is unbiased, has all data, and is tidy).

## The Rules

You can't ask the following questions or any iterations of these questions:
- Are you biased/unbiased?
- Do you have missing data/do you have all of your data?
- Are you tidy or untidy?
- Are you the data set we should pick?

You can ask questions such as:
- Are you from a .com, .gov, .net, or .org?
- Are all of your columns filled out?
- Have you left out any specific populations?
- Does each of your variables form a column?
