# Exercise: What's Trending?

## Introduction

Trends and patterns can be used to identify everything from success and failures to customer purchasing habits to predictions for future resource needs. But, can you pick out a positive trend vs. a negative trend or identify when a trend becomes a pattern? Let's find out. You will work individually to analyze data visualizations and determine if a trend (or trends) is present, whether that trend is positive or negative, and if that trend predicts a pattern.
