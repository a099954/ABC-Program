# Quiz: Statistics <!-- this quiz is not mandatory for progressive, so very few questions were loaded into LMS-->

## Statistical Thinking

### LO 1: Describe how statistical thinking affects professional and personal lives.

True or False: statistical thinking can help you recognize misleading visualizations in advertising?

**a. True**

b. False

When reading a research study, which of the following factors should you consider before believing the results?

a. sample size

b. level of significance

c. effect size

d. both a and b

**e. all of the above**

### LO 2: Explain why humans are prone to statistically flawed reasoning.

---------------------

*If you're flipping coins and you've just gotten five heads in a row, the next flip is more likely to be tails because tails is overdue.

a. True

b. **False**

## Measures of Central Tendency


### LO 3: Explain mean, median, mode, and skewing.

*Many companies provide their companies' mean salary to suggest how well they pay. Assume the company has a normal curve of salary distribution except for a group of senior manager outliers that have on average 1000X the lowest salary in the company.  What is the best measure of central tendency to understand how well a company pays in general in this situation?

a. Mean is the best measure
**b. Median is the best measure**
c. Mode is the best measure.
d. None of the Above.

*Many companies provide their companies' mean salary to suggest how well they pay. Assume the company has a normal curve of salary distribution except for a group of senior manager outliers that have on average 1000X the lowest salary in the company.  Draw the distribution out.  How will the salary distribution skew the data versus a normal curve? 

**a. Positive Skew**
b. Negative Skew
c. No change.

*In a factory, every day at different times when 3 or more manufacturing machines start up at the same time, there is a slight power surge. One sensor gives readings that are 1000X less than the normal mean readings during the power surge. Outside of the power surge, the sensor has low variance and readings follow a normal curve. How would this skew the data? 

a. Positive Skew
**b. Negative Skew**
c. No change.

## Introduction to Probability
