# Exercise: Probability in Insurance

## Introduction

Whether calculating that a smoker is more likely to have serious health issues when writing health and life insurance policies or taking the age and gender of a driver into consideration when calculating vehicle insurance, probability theory is used throughout the field of insurance. 

In this exercise, you will research common insurance considerations, determine the probability that an event will occur, and determine whether your sample subject is an insurance risk or not based on that data. 

## Calculating Probability

Reminder: probability can be calculated by dividing your expected or hypothesized number of outcomes by the total number of outcomes in your sample space. 

For example, the CDC states that lung cancer develops in 10-20% of all smokers. Another way of saying that is that 1 or 2 smokers (our expected outcome) out of every 10 (our sample space) will get lung cancer. So, the probability of a smoker getting lung cancer is between .1 and .2.

Using that information, you might deduce that a smoker would be at a higher risk for severe illness and death and would likely require them to pay more for health and life insurance coverage. This may also impact their homeowner's insurance if you decide there is a higher risk of fire. 

## Part 1: Your Sample Subjects <!-- do I need to call out that we're not using data on non-binary subjects because there isn't enough data available? we have had some trans/NB students and will likely have more in the future--> 

- Alex: 16-year-old male getting car insurance on his parents' policy
- Madison: 22-year-old female getting car insurance on her own
- Alex: 47-year-old smoker who is getting health insurance
- Jamie: 47-year-old smoker who is getting health insurance
- Emily: 32-year-old yoga instructor who is getting life insurance
- Destiny: 32-year-old welder who is getting life insurance
- Zachary: a 38-year-old homeowner who is getting homeowners insurance on his house. The house was built in 2008 in Denver, Colorado has central air, and was appraised at $995,000.
- Michone: a 38-year-old homeowner who is getting homeowners insurance on her house. The house was built in 2021 in New York City, New York, is semi-attached, has central air, and was appraised at $1,850,000. 

Review the subjects above and pick out the relevant information you think you need to research (Hint: Does a homeowner's age really impact their homeowner's insurance?).

## Part 2: Research

Time to get your data! Do some sleuthing online (Hint: cdc.gov will have a lot of this) to find out the stats you think you need to help you decide if your subject would be a risk to cover. Call back to what you've learned about gathering data and make sure you choose reliable sources. 

To get you started, here are a few considerations:

- Are teenage drivers more likely to be in car accidents than adult drivers?
- Do males or females get into more car accidents?
- Are smokers more likely to have severe health issues?
- Does your type of employment impact your health or life expectancy?
- Does the age of your home affect your homeowner's insurance?
- Does the location of your home affect your homeowner's insurance?

## Part 3: Calculate Your Probability

This is the hard part; using the data you've gathered, re-write it in a way that allows you to calculate the probability that certain events will happen (see the smoking example above).

To get you started, here are a few ways of looking at your data:

- How many teen males get into car accidents every year?
- How many smokers develop lung cancer, heart trouble, or COPD?
- Is there an average age that yoga instructors live to?
- What percentage of homes built before 2015 have needed their roofs replaced in Denver? What about in New York City?

## Part 4: Risky Business

Using your research and the probability you have calculated, are your sample subjects a high risk to cover? Why or why not? There's no wrong answer as long as your data and explanation support your decision. 

We will discuss your findings as a class once everyone is ready to share.
