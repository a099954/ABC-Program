# Exercise: Central Tendency War!

## Introduction

To solidify the concepts of mean, median, and mode, we're going to play a game that requires you to calculate those measures of central tendency and use those calculations to battle your classmates (with numbers).

## Part 1: Draw Your Cards

1. Go to the card drawer at [Random.org](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/)
1. Change the following steps:
    - Under Step 1: Draw 9 Cards
    - Under Step 2: De-select the Jacks, Queens, and Kings
1. Click the Draw Cards Button (You should now have nine cards in front of you to use for the next section of the exercise.)
1. Take a screenshot of your cards and share them directly with the instructor via direct message (don't share it to the class chat!). 

## Part 2: The Competition

1. Your instructor will ask you to calculate your mean, median, or mode.
    - If you have no mode, you get no points.
    - If you have two modes, you can add them together. 

1. Share your calculation with the class.
1. The participant with the highest mean, median, or mode wins that round. 

## Part 3: Victory!

The participant who has the highest score at the end of four rounds wins the game.
