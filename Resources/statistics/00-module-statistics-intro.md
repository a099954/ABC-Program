# Module: Statistics

## Introduction

This module lays the foundation for statistical thinking, explores descriptive statistics to quantitatively present features of a data sample, and explains probability and its use in making decisions in uncertainty. 

### Module Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

1. Apply statistical thinking when working with data.
1. Identify abnormalities and trends using descriptive statistics. 
1. Explain how to use probability to make sense of data uncertainty. 

## Scenario: But Wait, There's More!

Statistics are so ingrained in business decisions that we could use almost any example in any field and find some use of statistical thinking, descriptive statistics, or probability. So, let's use an example of a fictional cleaning product we'll call Moxie Clean that Squeaky Clean, Inc, developed.

As Squeaky Clean was looking for the next big thing, they completed a lot of market research. They polled consumers at grocery stores, janitors at schools and reviewed similar sales of competing products. From that data, they were able to see that there was a demand for the product. After completing a little statistical analysis, they could determine how many sales would be necessary to meet their break-even point of creating a new product. 

Now they had to evaluate their risk vs. reward. Using the data from their market research, they analyzed how Moxie Clean would sell in different markets and if any impending economical changes might impact sales. Luckily, even in times of hardship - people have to clean. So, they gave it the go-ahead. 

It was then time to do some forecasting using data from previous sales of similar products. They found that consumers were most likely to buy this product in the spring and as multiples, leading to the decision to have a limited 2-pack release of Moxie Clean in April of the following year. 

Before Moxie Clean hit the shelves, quality analysts at the plant where the product was created would randomly pull small samples and use that data to ensure that each batch was consistent in its chemical breakdown within a specified margin of error. 

Once Moxie Clean hits the shelves, additional analysis will be run to determine the probability of it being successful in other markets, assess customer satisfaction, and track any sales abnormalities. 

That's a lot of statistics in a little bottle of cleaner. But wait, there's more! Keep reading to learn more about using statistics to make better business decisions.
