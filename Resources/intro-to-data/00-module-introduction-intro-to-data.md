### Scenario: How Loyal Are Your Customers?

Let's say you've been hired as a data analyst for Vander Corp. This 50-year-old company designs and wholesales high-end kitchen appliances. People won't find your products at Lowe's or Home Depot. Sales come from various places; high-end general contractors, advertisements in luxury magazines, and word-of-mouth - at least that's what you were told when you were brought on board.

A new competitor has recently entered the market, and the board of directors expressed some concern at their last meeting. They are curious as to how loyal the current customer base is to Vander Corp's products. They've asked your team to present this information at the next board meeting.

Your team gathers together, and after the initial rumblings about how hard it will be to get the sales team to share their spreadsheets and the social media team to finally let someone look at their numbers, you decide that the first thing that you need to do is establish a **data culture**. It won't be an easy task. Vander Corp started out as a small shop with the majority of people and departments working in isolation. It's only been in the last ten years that the company has grown at a pace that's made the data silos painfully obvious.

Your team decides on an initial strategy - we must start internally with a **data management plan** then quickly follow up with getting retailers to share their data with us as well.

### Data-Driven Decision Making

If any of the scenario above sounds like the company you work for, then this course has been designed for you. The reality is that most organizations fail to get the most value out of their data. There are many reasons for this. Not everyone understands what data is capable of doing. Some are protective of their data because they've spent so much time making their spreadsheets do amazing things. Others are fearful of prying eyes, knowing too much about what's going on in their department.

No matter the reason, an organization that isn't data-driven is missing out on an opportunity to better understand themselves, their suppliers, and their customers - and inevitably losing out on the bottom line.
