# Exercise: What's Your Type?

## Introduction

Now that you are familiar with the four main data types (temporal, numeric & boolean, string, and other), it's time to see if you can spot those data types out in the wild. You'll be split into two groups and asked to review websites and identify as many data types as you can.

## Part 1: Review the Websites

Look through the websites below and identify which data types are represented and missing.

### Group One's Sites
