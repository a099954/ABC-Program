# Assessment: Cooking by the Book

## Introduction

In this module, we examined what it takes to be able to read data and write about data - the fundamental skill known as data literacy. In this final assessment, we will be bringing it all together. 

Please complete your answers in a document file that will be submitted separately from these instructions. 

Note: You should check in with your instructor between each part to ensure you are on the right track, then submit all of your work when complete.

## Part 1: Data vs Metadata vs Information

### Prompt

Using a restaurant menu as an example, describe the difference between data, metadata, and information. Provide examples of each.

## Part 2: Exploring Biases while Gathering Data

### Prompt

You have been tasked with going to your local neighborhoods to get recipes for your cookbook. How might cognitive and statistical bias appear? Please provide at least two ideas per bias.

## Part 3: Questioning Data

### Prompt

Suppose you want to open up a ramen restaurant. You happened to find data from a guy who rates ramen. Is this a good idea to use his data to determine whether to open up your own ramen restaurant? What other pieces of information would you want to consider for opening a ramen restaurant? 

## Part 4: Data Modeling

### Prompt

Create an ERD in second normal form for a cookbook with the following information:

- A cookbook contains many recipes made up of ingredients and steps. 
- We need to track the ingredients and steps for a recipe.
- A recipe may have a source, such as the 1944 Good Housekeeping Cookbook.
- We need to know what recipes have which ingredients.
- Each recipe belongs to a single category.
- We need to see all the recipes in a category.

## Part 5: Data Visualization

Once your cookbook is created, think about visualizations for the following questions (you don't have to create visualizations, just discuss them).

### Prompts

1. What data visualization would you use to show the number of recipes for each category? Justify your answer.

2. What data visualization would you use for showing the number of recipes that use butter versus the number of recipes that use margarine, by category? Justify your answer.

3. While we may like to eat pie, there are certain issues that come up with using a pie chart visualization. Discuss those concerns.
