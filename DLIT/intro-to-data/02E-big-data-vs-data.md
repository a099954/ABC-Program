# Exercise: Big Data vs. Data Debate

## Introduction

In this 30 minute activity, you will be presented with data examples and you will need to determine if it is an example of Big Data based on the three Vs of data:

- Volume: how much data is there?
- Velocity: how fast is the data coming in?
- Variety: how structured is the data?

You won't just be guessing, though. Be prepared to debate your classmates and defend your choice. <!--data examples in module PPT-->
