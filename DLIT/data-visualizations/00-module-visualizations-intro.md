# Module: Data Visualizations

## Introduction

Data visualizations help tell the data story. This module compares common data visualization types while explaining their benefits and challenges. This module also reviews identifying and interpreting trends and outliers. 

## **Module Outcomes** 

By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

1. Identify visualization types used in data analysis. 

1. Explain how the use of pie charts may impact data presentations. 

1. Discuss identifying trends as it relates to data analysis. 

1. Explain outliers and their impact on data analysis. 

## Scenario: Picture This

Take a look at the visualization below and think about what data it is presenting?

Give up? You should. While very pretty, nothing in this visualization tells us what information we should get from it. Visualizations are only helpful if they are the correct type, are clearly labeled, and account for trends and outliers (when needed). 

Are you planning on having a career in data analysis or data engineering? Visualizations will be your best friend when it's time to explain your plans to your (likely less-technically inclined) boss. 

You'll use visualizations to support your recommendations. For example:

"As you can see in this comparative time chart, relationship managers using our new point-of-sale system were able to complete transactions 5X faster than they could previously, and for that reason, we should invest in that POS for all of our locations." 

You'll use visualizations to identify and present trends and patterns. For example:

"We knew that sales in masks were trending up again, but after building this timeline chart over the last three years, we can see that those sales trend up every spring. So, we can conclude that is a pattern, and customers are likely replacing their masks every year around this time." 

You'll even use visualizations to help your team understand why they should or should not make accommodations for outliers. For example: 

"In this Excel sheet, you can see that temperatures in Tempe, Arizona, have been unusually high this summer, but our average seemed a bit off. Once we put all of the temperatures on a scatter plot, it was clear that two temperatures (191째F and 181째F) were actually due to a data entry error and were 119째F and 118째F, respectively."

Now, get ready to tell your stories and share your data with visualizations because a picture is worth a thousand words.
