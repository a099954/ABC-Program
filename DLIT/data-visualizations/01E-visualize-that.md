# Exercise: Visualize That

## Introduction

In this exercise, you'll work in groups of two or three to analyze data, determine which visualization type would best represent that data, and share your rationale with the class. 

## Part 1: Analyze Your Data

Once you are in your group, you will be assigned one of the following data sets to analyze:

- [Electric Car Comparisons](https://www.kaggle.com/geoffnel/evs-one-electric-vehicle-dataset)
- [Grocery Store Transactions](https://www.kaggle.com/shazadudwadia/supermarket)
- [Online Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/tylermorse/retail-business-sales-20172019)
- [Movies](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)
- [Memes](https://www.kaggle.com/abhishtagatya/imgflipscraped-memes-caption-dataset)

## Part 2: What's Your Type? <!--note to add to instructor guide, there really isn't a wrong answer here as long as they can back up their decision using content from the lesson-->

Discuss your data, and as a group, determine which of the following visualization types would best represent your data (you can choose more than one):

- Word Cloud
- Timeline
- Mind Map
- Graph (bar or line)
- Plots (scatter or box)
- Histogram
- Chart (flow, KDE, or pie)
- Venn Diagram
- Map

## Part 3: Presentation and Discussion

Return to the main classroom and share which visualization(s) your group chose and why you felt that visualization was best for your data.

## Part 4: Stretch Goal - Create a Visualization

We will dive into creating visualizations later in this cohort, but if your team finishes picking their visualization early and you would like to try making that visualization - go for it! You can use PowerPoint, Excel, or just draw it in Microsoft Paint or on a piece of paper and share a photo with the class.
