# Module: Gathering Data

## Introduction

Before we can analyze data, we have to gather it. You may think it's as simple as a Google search, but you'll soon find out that it isn't always that easy. In this module, we look at common data formats and identify ethical data sources.

## Module Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

1. Identify the various files source types used in data storage. 
1. Explain databases in the context of data storage. 
1. Discuss online datasets as they relate to data analysis. 

## Scenario: Research that Funky Music

You were recently promoted to a senior analyst position at Jazzy James Records LLC. Your first task is to determine whether the US market is ready for the newest KPop sensation N.O.1.Z.3. - but where should you start?

(If your answer is "With the data?" you've been paying attention.)

First, you want to look up other KPop bands that your competing record companies represent by taking advantage of the open data on music popularity that is available online. Luckily, even though artists, albums, and song titles are typically unstructured data, you're able to export that information into a text file so it's easier to digest. Now you need to look at the relationships between those albums and the states they successfully sold in. Naturally, you build a relational database for your research and design a graph database to help your boss visualize those relationships. 

Now you can confidently report back to your boss that if you aggressively market N.O.1.Z.3. in Los Angeles, New York, and Austin and get their ads to play during YouTube videos for BTS and BlackPink, they're sure to be a success in the US. 

If this sounds like the kind of solution you want to provide future employers, buckle up. We're heading into the world of data gathering.
