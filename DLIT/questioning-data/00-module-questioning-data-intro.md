# Module: Questioning Data

## Introduction

Data is readily available, but not all data is created equal. Data can be intentionally or unintentionally misleading, impact other data, or look like it impacts other data, but it doesn't. In this lesson, we'll explore methods you can use to question data and explain the relationship between correlation and causation. 

## Module Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

1. Critically think about data. 
1. Differentiate between correlation and causation. 
1. Explain the relationship between correlation and causation.

## Scenario: Question the Cause

Let's take a look at a well-known fact shared throughout Psychology 101 courses across the world.

As ice cream sales increase in a given city, so does the violent crime rate. It's true - feel free to research it. 

Given just that data, can we make any assumptions? Maybe people get a sugar rush from ice cream and go on a crime spree. Maybe after committing violent crimes, offenders like to relax with a bit of rocky road. Maybe they're not related at all...

Any time you're presented with data, you should take a moment to question it. Where did you get this data? Is it raw data, or has it been filtered? Is there so much data being presented that you should break it down into chunks to understand it better? Is data missing? Is that data reacting to other data?

In our example above, you could say that increased ice cream sales correlate with increased violent crime, but can you prove causation? Not really. 

However, if you took the time to ask questions, you might wonder what else happened during those same periods and would see that both of those data points occur on the hottest days of the year. Now, you can find a direct line of causation from people getting too warm and wanting to cool off with a sweet treat...or escalating violence during a crime because heat makes them anxious and angry. 

This is just a silly example professors like to throw around. Still, you can use the same questioning process to evaluate data and react accordingly if you find causation or correlation in the business world.
