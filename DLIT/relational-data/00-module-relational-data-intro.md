# Module: Relational Data

## Module Intro

This module reviews best practices when working with relational data, analyzing data through data modeling, and introduces foundational data management tools such as Structured Query Language (SQL) and Azure Data Studio (ADS).

## Module Outcomes

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1. Analyze data and extrapolate relevant information from that data.
1. Differentiate between the various data types.
1. Identify, choose, and manage relevant data from an SQL query.
1. Explain data relationships.

## Scenario: Data Draft

Let's say you're putting together your first fantasy football draft party and the friends you've invited are also new to drafting. You want everyone to have a good time and pick the players they need for their teams, so you want to provide as much data as possible to help them make their choices. There's only one problem, there is a ton of data for each player â€“ how can you possibly organize and interpret all that information?

As you complete this module, keep this scenario in mind and ask yourself these questions throughout the lessons:

* When you gather player data, what is irrelevant? Do you really need to look at rushing yards for a kicker?  
* How would you organize your player data?  
* Do you want to compare all players that play a particular position or just the top 50?  
* How would you visually represent everyone's stats?  
* Would it be helpful to narrow down your player options and then further evaluate that group with a subquery?  

Whether you intend to use relational data to put together an employee database or just improve your fantasy draft, starting with foundational relational data management is the key to success.
