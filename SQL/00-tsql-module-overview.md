# Module Overview: Relational Data/SQL

## Module Introduction

Microsoft SQL Server uses a dialect of SQL known as Transact-SQL (TSQL). In this module, we explore using TSQL syntax for querying data, including how to filter and aggregate data for analysis.

## Module Outcomes

1. Identify, choose, and manage relevant data from an SQL query.
1. Filter and aggregate data in a table.
1. Differentiate between the various data types.
1. Explain how to manage relationships between tables with JOINs.
1. Explain the use of subqueries.

## Scenario: Making Magic with SQL

You did it - You've won the "Galaxy Magic Cup" and are the undeniable champion of Magic: The Convocation. There's only one problem. While on your journey to be number one, you've accumulated quite a collection of cards. You estimate you have at least 60,000! How can you organize all of that data in an easy-to-query way? Well, it's dangerous to go alone, so why not take SQL with you?

You'll start by building a database of card stats with tables such as all cards, card cost, card worth, mana cost, abilities, previously used cards, etc. Once your data is loaded into these tables, you'll be able to retrieve specific data using basic queries like 'limit' and 'distinct" and filter and sort to restrict your results.

Of course, it could be difficult to remember which cards you've used since you have so many, but that's where JOINs come in. For example, to find the names of the cards you recently used, you could join your "All Cards" table with the "Previously Used Cards" table.

Now we could dive deeper into how you'd use aggregation, subqueries, and many other SQL functions to organize your deck, but what would be left to learn in the module? Your Relational Data & SQL quest awaits.
