# Exercise: Data Organization in Excel

## Introduction

In the Data Organization Lesson, we learned how to research an Excel workbook through INDEX/MATCH, parse strings, format tables, and calculate formulas over arrays/ranges using various built-in Excel functions and formulas. In this exercise, you'll be asked to use these methods to solve four problems.

## Data Sheets

For this exercise, all of the data you'll need is in the [Data Organization](assets/files/03E-data-organization.xlsx) spreadsheet.

The tabs correspond with each sheet/topic: US Population, Celebrity Names, Grades, and the FIFA World Cup.

## Part 1: INDEX & MATCH

For this part of the exercise, use the US Population tab to practice using INDEX and MATCH functions.

1. Enter a formula in cell G4 that will look up the population for the given state.
2. Test using multiple states.

## Part 2: Parsing Strings

For this part of the exercise, use the Celebrity Names tab to practice using LEFT, RIGHT, and MID functions to parse data.

1. Parse the full names from column A into their respective first, middle, and last names.

## Part 3: Conditional Formatting

For this part of the exercise, use the Grades tab to practice conditional formatting.

1. Identify GPAs according to color:  
    * A (3.5 to 4.0, Green)
    * B (2.5 to 3.5, Blue)
    * C (1.5 to 2.5, Yellow)
    * D (1.0 to 1.5, Orange)
    * F (Below 1.0, Red)

## Part 4: Array Formulas

For this part of the exercise, use the FIFA World Cup tab to practice using array formulas.

1. Count the number of championships for each winning country.  
2. Enter your data (unique countries) in the Winner column (I1).
3. Enter your formula in the Championships column (J1).  

(Hint: Use the *Unique* function if you don't want to manually populate the unique countries.)
