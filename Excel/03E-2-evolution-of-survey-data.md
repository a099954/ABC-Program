# Exercise: Evolution of Survey Data

## Introduction

In this exercise, you'll work in pairs to create visualizations and answer questions based on candy survey data. 

## Part 1: Group Up

You'll be assigned to one of four breakout rooms and your group will be assigned one of the following datasets

* [2014 Candy Survey Data](https://github.com/stage3talent/curriculum-DANL/blob/463c6f6ba686b151cc9fbfb1a564eb928e8e212f/Excel/assets/activities/Candy-Data-2014.xlsx)
* [2015 Candy Survey Data](https://github.com/stage3talent/curriculum-DANL/blob/606c6572701038ecd73c1fe89eda9f93adbf13ec/Excel/assets/activities/Candy-Data-2015.xlsx)
* [2016 Candy Survey Data](https://github.com/stage3talent/curriculum-DANL/blob/606c6572701038ecd73c1fe89eda9f93adbf13ec/Excel/assets/activities/Candy-Data-2016.xlsx)
* [2017 Candy Survey Data](https://github.com/stage3talent/curriculum-DANL/blob/606c6572701038ecd73c1fe89eda9f93adbf13ec/Excel/assets/activities/Candy-Data-2017.xlsx)

## Part 2: Visualizations

1. Explore your assigned dataset.
2. Create visualizations to share with the class that show your understanding of the dataset. 

## Part 3: Questions

For 2014-2016, look at how the survey evolved. For 2017, explore 2016 to see how they changed. 

Answer the following questions:
1. If you had to transform the surveys to get them in one data table, what would the transformation steps look like?
2. If you had to create visualizations to compare the years, what would those be?

## Part 4: Presentation

Present your group's findings to the class.
